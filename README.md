# Speckled - a library for talking to SPARQL endpoints

* SPARQL DSL
* network code for talking to SPARQL endpoint

Status as of June 2016: under active (if slow) development,
pre-pre-Alpha, APIs will change probably without notice.  Hopefully
there is enough here to illustrate the direction in which we think
we're going, but there are significant gaps which I will probably only
get to when I actually need the functionality.

# SPARQL DSL

Most of Speckled is a DSL for creating SPARQL queries.  Here's a
fairly simple example to show it off a bit

    (ns my-namespace
      (:require [speckled.dsl :refer :all]
                [speckled.rdf :refer [u]]))

    ;; (speckled.dsl is written with some care about preserving its
    ;; public/private interface and the intention is that it should be
    ;; safe to :refer :all without spamming your application
    ;; namespaces with incidental crud.  Please flag if/where you find
    ;; this not to be the case)

    (->string
     (select
      (project [(? :a)]
               (solve
                (group [(? :a)
                        :rdfs:label
                        "Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation"]
                       [(? :a) :rdf:type :dct:Agent] )))))
    =>
    PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>
    PREFIX rdau: <http://rdaregistry.info/Elements/u/>
    [... more prefix declarations omitted for brevity ...]
    SELECT *  WHERE {
      ?a <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label> \"Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation\" .
      ?a <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/Agent>}

## Language structure

The structure of the language was designed by looking at the SPARQL
specification through half-closed eyes: it's inspired by the official
SPARQL grammar but takes some liberties in the interests of
pragmatism/conciseness/convenience.  From the inside out:


### Terms: literals, IRIs, variables

- Literals are represented as strings (no support for language selection yet)

- URL and URI objects are converted to IRI refs.  You can say `(u "foo")` to easily create a URL relative to `speckled.rdf/rdf-base-uri`

- keywords are also converted to IRI, if they match one of the declared prefixes in `speckled.rdf/prefixes`

- Variables are represented as `Variable` objects.  You can create them with the `?` function 

### Triples

A triple is a vector of three terms: [subject relation object]

### Graphs: groups of triples (and groups of groups)

Speckled presently supports

* group graph patterns:
  https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#GroupPatterns

* `UNION` for unions of groups:
  https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#alternatives

* `BIND` for binding - augment the variables in a graph with a new
  variable whose value is derived from them:
  https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#bind


More composition operations will be added as I need them.

### Solution, solution sequence

Given a graph with some variables, a solution is some set of values
for each of the variables which cause make the graph match data in the data
store

A solution sequence is a collection of all the possible solutions for some graph

### solution sequence modifiers

Filter, narrow or re-order the solution sequence using operators like `project` (equates to SPARQL `SELECT`), `distinct`, `limit` etc

#### So what's this `project` thing for, then?

The `SELECT` clause in a SPARQL query serves dual duty

* first as a solution sequence modifier which narrows the result
sequence by removing some of the variables from it (in relational
algebra we would describe this as a "projection" or "restriction"),

* and second to indicate the form of the result to the SPARQL
processor - that we want to know the values of the variables (as
opposed to, e.g. whether a solution exists (`ASK`) or a new set of
triples that use them (`CONSTRUCT`)).

In Speckled we separate these two roles: we use `project` for the
"Projection" operator that narrows the solution sequence, and then we
use `select` to indicate the result format.

Speckled is not dogmatic about making you write `project` and `select`
explicitly in your queries if it can figure out that it needed either
or both of them (see "Convenience shortcuts" below), but you will
probably have an easier ride if your mental model embraces this
distinction instead of treating it as magic :-)

### Top level forms

These say what we want done with the solution sequence.  In SPARQL these are

  * SELECT - tell me the values
  * CONSTRUCT - make up some new triples
  * INSERT - make up some new triples and add them to the data store
  * etc

## Convenience shortcuts

1. you can usually omit writing `solve` where its necessity can be
inferred: any operator that requires a solution sequence will wrap its
argument in one if it isn't already

2. you can omit `project` if you don't want to restrict the variables
returned, and if you omit the operator to specify the top level form
type (`select`, `construct`, `ask`, `insert` ...) then it will assume
that you wanted a `SELECT`. So you can write simple queries much more
concisely: e.g.

```
     (->string
        (group [(? :a)
                :rdfs:label
                "Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation"]
               [(? :a) :rdf:type :dct:Agent] )))))

```
to get

     SELECT *  WHERE {
       ?a <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label> "Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation" .
       ?a <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/Agent>
     }

or something, modulo whitespace changes, very much like it.


# Talking to SPARQL servers

    (def post-http (comp http/post :body))

    (speckled.net/query post-http "http://localhost:3030/ds/"
                        "SELECT  ?p ?o WHERE { </foo/2> ?p ?o }")

Presently there are separate functions for different top level forms

* for SELECT use `query`
* for INSERT use `insert-store`
* for CONSTRUCT use `query-graph`

This is ugly and I will look at unifying these interfaces just as soon as I have a good idea how to

## Choose your own HTTP library

(If you don't have your own HTTP library you can always choose to use
somebody else's ;-)

The first argument to `query` is the function that your preferred HTTP
client uses to do a POST request.  It should accept the same arguments
as `clj-http.client/post` _and return the response body as a string.
For example, to use the client from HTTP-Kit you might say

    (def post-http (comp deref org.httpkit.client/post))

or to use Aleph (which returns a Manifold deferred instead of giving
you a response directly, and as of 0.4.1 doesn't support `{:as
:text}`) you could do 

    (def post-http (comp slurp :body deref http/post))
